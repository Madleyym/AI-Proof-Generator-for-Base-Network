      "response": "Base is Ethereum's Layer 2 (L2) blockchain solution built by Coinbase. It's designed to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications. Base uses optimistic rollup technology to bundle transactions off the main Ethereum chain, resulting in significantly lower gas fees (typically under $0.01) while maintaining Ethereum-level security."

      "response": "Gas fees on Base Network are significantly lower than Ethereum mainnet. Average transaction costs on Base are typically $0.001 - $0.01, compared to Ethereum's $5-$50+ during peak times. This makes Base ideal for frequent transactions, NFT minting, and DeFi activities without worrying about high costs."
